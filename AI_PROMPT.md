AI PROMPT USED (Transparency)

Tool: ChatGPT (OpenAI model GPT-5.1)

Prompt:
“Help me structure, review, and improve the readability, modularity, documentation,
and production-readiness of my C# implementation for the OldPhonePad coding challenge.
Do not solve the problem for me. I will provide the algorithm and implementation,
and you help with formatting, clarity, structure, separation of concerns, folder
organization, test harness design, and documentation only.”

Note:  
All core logic, algorithm design, and implementation are fully written by me.
AI assistance was used strictly to:
- Improve code structure
- Write documentation
- Suggest folder layout
- Improve readability
- Suggest testing practices
No problem-solving or logic derivation was done by AI.
